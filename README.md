# Disease Prediction System using Machine Learning

## Project Description:
The "Disease Prediction System using Machine Learning" is an intelligent system developed to predict the likelihood of a person having a particular disease based on various health-related features. The system utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze historical health data, contributing to early disease detection and proactive healthcare management.

## Project Objectives:
1. **Data Collection:**
   - Gather a diverse dataset containing relevant health features, including but not limited to age, gender, BMI, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and family medical history.
2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Perform thorough data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data quality.
   - Normalize or standardize features to bring them to a consistent scale.
3. **Feature Selection:**
   - Employ feature selection techniques to identify the most influential variables for disease prediction.
   - Ensure that selected features contribute significantly to the accuracy of the machine learning models.
4. **Model Development:**
   - Explore and implement various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines for disease prediction.
   - Evaluate and compare the performance of different models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Cross-Validation:**
   - Implement cross-validation techniques to assess the generalization performance of the models and mitigate overfitting.
6. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   - Fine-tune the hyperparameters of selected machine learning models to optimize their performance.
